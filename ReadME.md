## 🔍 What This App Does

- 📁 Upload financial `.json` documents (from `test_documents/`)
- ❓ Ask natural-language financial questions
- 🤖 Choose a model: Mistral, GPT-Neo, or TinyLLaMA
- 💬 Receive context-aware answers generated by the selected model
- 📊 Compare metrics and visualize performance across models

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model      | Size     | Fine-Tuned | Access |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Mistral    | 7B       | ✅         | [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cuxBjfQcvEwZl8PrX4fbsFucH7PJMwri?usp=drive_link) |
| GPT-Neo    | 1.3B     | ✅         | [Same link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cuxBjfQcvEwZl8PrX4fbsFucH7PJMwri?usp=drive_link) |
| TinyLLaMA  | 1.1B     | ✅         | [Same link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cuxBjfQcvEwZl8PrX4fbsFucH7PJMwri?usp=drive_link) |

> These models were trained on the [ConvFinQA dataset](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/ConvFinQA) and tested on both seen and unseen financial questions.
